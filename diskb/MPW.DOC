	*******************************************************************
	HI THERE, MSX LOVERS!!!

	I don't know English, I speak a little bit of  "Brazilian-English",
	so, there must be a lot of mistakes in the text bellow, but I  hope
	it may help someone.

	THIS  PROGRAM  IS  PUBLIC  DOMAIN,  it  can  be  freely  used  and
	distributed  for  non-comercial  purposes.

	If you have any suggestions, any useful routine or trick, or even
	if you want to play TIC-TAC-TOE by mail. Write to:

	*******************************************************************


	The MPW is a  program  based  in years  of  coding  experience  and
"hacking"; and it was developed with the aim of being  a  powerful  editing
tool for programs or even for normal text maintenance. The most  emphasized
features during MPW development were:

	- Its speed;
	- Its display;
	- Its editing capacity;
	- Its unique functions and so on...

	The MPW has 3 files: MPW.COM, the code itself - MPW.DOC,  the  text
you're reading - and its config file MPW.INF. The last one has informations
about the options selected in preferences window, if it is not  present  on
disk, the default options will be used. 


	-- The Display --

	MPW's display looks like PC SideKick.

	The VDP works in text mode 2 (screen 0 / 80 columns), the image  is
vertically extended by the LN bit on vdp register 9, there are 4  different
colors out of 512, for foreground, background, border, and title.

	The screen's first line is the title line (or status line), and  it
appears with its own color, notice that the title line's  foreground  color
is the same as border color.  The  title  line  shows  the  most  important
informations about the text being  edited,  that  are:  the  filename,  the
cursor line, the column, the indent mode (activated or  not),  the  writing
mode (insert or overwrite), and the Caps Lock state.

** Note **  The title line is also used to show the available  memory  (^K,
	    ^Q, ^O) and another program messages.

	In the screen last line, we can see the definitions  given  to  the
function keys in the MPW, the rest of lines are used by  the  edit  window.
Notice that, when split mode becomes active the screen is divided to  allow
the simultaneous view of both texts.


	-- The Available Memory --

	The program uses all drives available to system, including those in
RAM, so, the more drives  you  have  less  available  memory  there'll  be.
Remember that, during RESET you can press Ctrl to disable logical drives or
Delete to disable the MEGA RAM-DISK, releasing more memory to your text.

	The MPW uses all available area for ".COM" programs minus the stack
area and the resident modules area. The currently available memory  can  be
seen in the title line when we use a command prefix (^K, ^Q and ^O).

	Notice that, the available memory is  always  major  than  what  is
seen, due to internal conversions that are made when the  files  are  read,
and made again when files are written back to disk.


	-- The Commands --

	The MPW commands follow the WordStar / SideKick standard  and  they
are single keys, or combinations of 2 or more keys. The symbol  ^  or  Ctrl
denotes the use of <CONTROL>, any definition between < > refers to a key.

** Examples **	Ctrl-F	 = <CONTROL> + <F>;
		Ctrl-K-B = <CONTROL> + <K>, <B>;
		Return   = <RETURN>, <ENTER> or <CR>


	-- Cursor Movement Commands --

Left arrow		or Ctrl-S	Move to left
Right arrow		or Ctrl-D	Move to right
Up arrow		or Ctrl-E	Move to previous line
Down arrow		or Ctrl-X	Move to next line
Ctrl-Left arrow		or Ctrl-A	Move to previous word
Ctrl-Right arrow	or Ctrl-F	Move to next word
Ctrl-Up arrow		or Ctrl-R	Move to previous page (PG UP)
Ctrl-Down arrow		or Ctrl-C	Move to next page (PG DOWN)
Home			or Ctrl-Q-S	Go to beginning of line
Shift-Home		or Ctrl-Q-E	Go to beginning of page
Ctrl-Home		or Ctrl-Q-R	Go to beginning of text
Ctrl-Q-B				Go to beginning of block
Select			or Ctrl-Q-D	Go to end of line
Shift-Select		or Ctrl-Q-X	Go to end of page
Ctrl-Select		or Ctrl-Q-C	Go to end of text
Ctrl-Q-K				Go to end of block
Ctrl-W					Scroll down
Ctrl-Z					Scroll up
Ctrl-B					Auto Ctrl-Z
Ctrl-U					Auto Ctrl-W


	-- The Clipboard --

	The clipboard is a special buffer for  text  handling, that  is,  a
memory area for draft. With it, we can duplicate /  move  lines  or  blocks
even to another text.

	With Shift-Ins we can copy the clipboard into text, notice that the
text is inserted in cursor position and that we can  use  this  combination
several times; in several points of text to  duplicate  the  same  part  of
text.

	There are situations in which the line or block that we're handling
is copied into clipboard, it happens in the following situations:

	- When we kill a line with Ctrl-Y, it is copied into clipboard, so,
	  we can move or duplicate lines;

	- When we kill a block with Ctrl-K-Y, it is copied into  clipboard,
	  so, we can retrive it after its erasing;

	- When we move a block with Ctrl-K-V;

	- And finally, when we mark a block with Ctrl-K-B and Ctrl-K-K, so,
	  we can use the clipboard (rather than Ctrl-K-C) to copy the block
	  even to another text. (e.g.: the 2nd window)


** Examples **	Suppose you have the text bellow:

1	;-------- Video Variables --------
2	&interlace:	db #ff
3	&ntsc_pal:	db 0
4	&key_click:	db #ff
5	&video_adjust:	db 0
6	&text_color:	dw %000000000		;black		0,0,0
7	&paper_color:	dw %111111111		;white		7,7,7
8	&border_color:	dw %001001111		;dark blue	1,1,7
9	&title_color:	dw %101101101		;gray		5,5,5

* Erasing the line 7 with Ctrl-Y; and using Shift-Ins 3 times in  the  same
  position, will do 3 copies of line 7.

* Erasing the line 5 with Ctrl-Y; moving the cursor  to  the  beginning  of
  line 3 and using Shift-Ins; will move line 5 between lines 2 and 3!!


	-- The Blocks --

	A block is a defined area of text, it  is  indicated  with  inverse
characters, the blocks are used in  several  editing  operations  such  as:
copy, move, kill, and so on... All  block  commands  are  preceded  by  the
Ctrl-K prefix.

	To mark a block we should define its beginning and end,  to  define
its beginning we use Ctrl-K-B, that is,  we  move  the  cursor  to  desired
position and type Ctrl-K-B; to define its end we use Ctrl-K-K. Notice  that
for obvious reasons the end must be defined AFTER beginning.

	Using Ctrl-K-H we can make the block visible or invisible, however,
in both cases the block stills defined. Notice that when we insert or  when
we delete characters inside the block, it  can  increase  or  decrease  its
length or even disappear if we delete all its contents.

	Keep in mind: When a block is defined it is copied into clipboard!!


** Note **  To do any operation described bellow, you need to have a  block
	    defined in the text.


	-- Finding the Block in the Text --

	To find a block defined in  the  text,  we  can  use  Ctrl-Q-B  and
Ctrl-Q-K to go to its beginning or its end; we can  also  use  Ctrl-K-H  to
make the block visible / invisible.


	-- Duplicating, Moving, Erasing and Printing Blocks --

	To erase a block we use Ctrl-K-Y, notice that the block  is  copied
into clipboard to allow a subsequent retrieval; to print  a  block  we  use
Ctrl-K-P, the printing can be interrupted with Ctrl-Stop.

** Note **  The printing routine doesn't work very well, so, don't rely  on
	    it!! (you better use MSX-DOS to print files)

	To copy or to move a block we use  Ctrl-K-C  and  Ctrl-K-V,  notice
that we can't copy or move a block to anywhere inside itself. The diference
between copy and move is that to copy means to duplicate the block contents
in another position, while to move means that the block will  be  moved  to
another position. Notice that, copy and move commands always put the  block
at the beginning of cursor line. (if you don't want this effect, you better
use clipboard).


** Notes **  A beep sound during MPW  operation  means  that  there  wasn't
	     enough memory to do the desired operation;  (It  is  gonna  be
	     improved soon);

	     If we use Ctrl-K-P, and there's no block defined then all text
	     will be printed;

	     The Ctrl-K-V uses the clipboard as  a  temporary  buffer,  so,
	     you can't move blocks with more than  16K. In  this  case  you
	     should use the disk as buffer. (See Ctrl-K-W and Ctrl-K-R).


	-- Copying Blocks From a Text to Another --

	The blocks, when they're defined, are copied into clipboard; notice
that, the Ctrl-Y also uses the clipboard, so, if it is used after  a  block
definition the block won't be present in the  clipboard  anymore.  In  this
case you should redefine the block (only the beginning or the end).

	After  the  block  has  been  defined  (and  has  been  copied   to
clipboard), we just need to move the cursor to the  desired  text,  in  the
desired position and then use Shift-Ins. Notice that, we can copy the block
several times in the text, and that we can use the clipboard,  rather  than
Ctrl-K-C, to copy the block to the same text.


	-- Changing Block Case --

	A special resource very useful for code editing, present in the MPW
are the block-change-case commands. We can mark a big  block,  a  line,  or
just a word; and then use  Ctrl-K-E  to  change  the  block  to  UPPERCASE,
Ctrl-K-L to change the block to lowercase, and  finally  Ctrl-K-F  to  flip
the block, that is, what is uppercase will be lowercase and vice versa.


	-- Reading and Writing Blocks --

	Another very useful resource are the  block  reading  and   writing
commands. To read a block we use Ctrl-K-R, and then we choose a  file  (see
reading files), the block read from disk will be  inserted  in  the  cursor
position and will be defined as a block, that is, will be highlighted.

	To write a block to disk, we use Ctrl-K-W and then we choose a file
(see writing files), notice that, there must be a block defined.


** The following is list of the block handling commands **

Ctrl-K-B		Mark block beginning
Ctrl-K-K		Mark block end
Ctrl-K-H		Show / Hide the block
Ctrl-K-C		Duplicate the block
Ctrl-K-V		Move the block
Ctrl-K-Y		Kill (erase) the block
Ctrl-K-P		Print the block
Ctrl-K-I		Indent the block (insert spaces on left)
Ctrl-K-U		Unindent the block
Ctrl-K-E		Change block to UPPERCASE
Ctrl-K-L		Change block to lowercase
Ctrl-K-F		Flip block case
Ctrl-K-R		Read a block from disk
Ctrl-K-W		Write a block to disk


	-- Other Commands --

	Although these commands have a Ctrl-K  prefix,  they  aren't  block
handling commands, and they are:

Ctrl-K-Q or Ctrl-K-X	Quit MPW;
Ctrl-K-D		Save text and quit;
Ctrl-K-S		Save text, but always shows the saving window.


	-- Reading Files and Viewing the Directory --

	In the MPW, we use F6 to see the disk directory, F3 to read a  file
and Ctrl-K-R to read a block from disk. When we do any of these  operations
the MPW presents a window that shows the operation to be done and  asks  us
for a file specification. It is  build  of  an  optional  drive  identifier
(a letter - A, B, ...) followed by a colon plus the filename, this filename
may contain wild cards (? and *) and it follows the MSX-DOS standard.

** Examples **	A:*.*		All files from drive A;
		M*.*		All files from  current  drive  that  start
				with letter M;
		B:*.TXT		All files from drive B that  have  the  TXT
				extension;
		ZZSOURCE.DOC	The file ZZSOURCE.DOC.

** Note **	If there are invalid characters in the  file  specification
		or if the specified drive doesn't exist, the  specification
		won't be accepted.

	If the file specification has no wild cards, the file  in  question
(in the case of F3 and Ctrl-K-R) will be read from disk. In the	case of dir
(F6) only that file will be showed, if it exists.

	If the file specification has any wild card, the set  of  files  in
question will be showed, and in the  dir  case  (F6),  only  the  directory
pagination will be allowed. In the case of F3 and  Ctrl-K-R  a  select  bar
will be showed, and the user will be able to move it with the  arrow  keys;
using Return over a filename will read the desired file from disk since  it
is an ASCII text.

	The difference between read a file (F3) and read a block (Ctrl-K-R)
is that in the first case the current text will be COMPLETELY  ERASED,  and
in the second case the read text is INSERTED in cursor position.


	-- Portuguese Accentuation and Internal Conversions --

	The MPW is fully compatible with ASCII texts,  however,  the  ASCII
standard defines only 128 codes, the other codes, in the MSX, are  used  to
represent accents, math  symbols  and  other  graphic  characters.  Due  to
coding needs only the characteres of the Portuguese language are  respected
by the MPW, the unsupported  characters  are  changed  to  a  question mark
character.

	Every text, when it is read by the MPW, also due to  coding  needs,
undergoes "little internal changes" transparents to the user. Due to  these
changes, the files can decrease their length up to 10% when they  are  read
and, of course, they come back to their normal length when they are written
back to disk.

	Some of the MSX faults (at least of ours!), that  is  corrected  by
the MPW, is that we just can't get the characters ~ and ` by the  keyboard;
though these characters belong to the standard ASCII table. In the MPW,  if
an accent  is  typed  twice  the  respective  character  is  obtained,  the
character ~ (til) for example, is necessary in the  C  language  'cause  it
represents the boolean operation NOT.

** Note **	If Shakespeare lived today he'd likely say: 2B|~2B !!


	-- Writing Texts and Blocks ---

	In the MPW we use Ctrl-K-W  to  write  a  block  to  disk  and  F2,
Ctrl-K-S or Ctrl-K-D to save a text. The difference among the last three is
that: Ctrl-K-D saves the text and quits the  program;  Ctrl-K-S  saves  the
text but always shows the saving window; and F2 also saves but doesn't show
the saving window whenever possible.

	When we do any of these operations the MPW, if necessary, shows the
saving window that tells us about the operation to be done and asks us  for
a file specification; this specification is the same as  the  previous  but
doesn't allow the use of wild cards (? and *).

	After we provide the file specification, the MPW asks us if we want
to replace the tabs by spaces, so, a verification is done and if  the  file
already exists on disk a save confirmation will be asked.

** Note **	To use Ctrl-K-W there must be a block defined;


	-- The Tab --

	The code  9  in  the  ASCII  standard  represents  the  tab,  which
indicates that the cursor should be moved to the next  tabulation,  in  the
MPW case, to the next 8 column boundary. The tab can be used to save memory
since a single tab (9) can represent up to 8 spaces.

	But in many cases, it is necessary  to  change  the  tabs  for  the
respective number of spaces (to export the text for example). In the MPW it
can be done by just asking the respective question in the saving window.


	-- The Tab Key and the Indent Mode --

	When the MPW is ran you can see an "Indent" in the title line, that
reminds you that the indent mode is activated, to turn it on or off we  use
Ctrl-Q-I or Ctrl-Tab.

	When this mode is activated, and the insert mode also does or if we
are in the text bottom, the next line will be tabulated  with  the  current
line, that is, the necessary number of  spaces  will  be  inserted  in  the
beginning of the next line to make it start in the  same  column  that  the
current does.

** Example **

	In this case the indent mode is activated, <RETURN>
	you can see that the lines were tabulated. <RETURN>
	<RETURN>
	Now the indent mode will be turned off <Ctrl-Q-I> <RETURN>
as you can see now, this line isn't tabulated <RETURN>
as the previous ones are.


	The indent mode becomes really useful when we're writing "indented"
programs, that is, written in structured  languages  such  as:  C,  Pascal,
Dbase, Clipper, and so on...

	Watch the following code and notice that how  it  could  be  easily
written with the indent mode.


FUNCTION  READ_DIR (FILESPEC)

   FILELIST = ""
   FILECOUNT = 0
   IF EMPTY (FILESPEC)
      FILESPEC = "*.*"
   ENDIF
   ARQ = FINDFIRST (FILESPEC)
   IF EMPTY (ARQ)
      RETURN .F.
   ENDIF
   DO WHILE !EMPTY (ARQ)
      FILECOUNT++
      AADD (FILELIST,ARQ)
      ARQ = FINDNEXT (FILESPEC)
   ENDDO
   RETURN .T.


** Note **	The tab key, normally, only inserts the tab code (9) in the
		text, however, with the indent mode activated, the tab  key
		tabulates the cursor with the previous line.


	-- The Disk Errors --

	Unfortunately, the MSX-DOS doesn't provide an efficient support for
disk access, mainly if we consider the errors handling. Most programs  that
run under the MSX-DOS environment also don't  provide  any  kind  of  error
handling procedure, so, when an error occurs, the programs usually crash or
"come back" to the system.

	The MPW, due to the techniques discovered  with  the  hacking,  can
handle the errors in an efficient manner. When a disk error occurs,  it  is
shown in the title line or in the last given command window; and  then  the
MPW waits for a key press.

	The possible errors are:

	<< Drive not ready >>	It happens when we try to access  the  disk
	drive and it is opened, turned off or without a disk;

	<< Disk write proctected >>   It  happens  when  we  try  to  write
	something to disk, and it is with the protection tab;

	<< Disk I/O error >>   It happens when there's a reading or writing
	error in the disk;

	<< Too many files >>   It  happens  during   saving   process   and
	indicates that file limit per directory is already reached;

	<< Disk full >>   It happens during saving  process  and  indicates
	that there's no enough space in the disk for more data.


** Note **	In the MPW, the message: "Insert disk for  drive  x..."  is
		showed in the title line.


	-- Help On-line --

	The MPW has a help window that can be accessed  at  any  time  with
<F1>. It shows a summary of all commands explained here, the help  is  self
explanatory.


	-- The Split Mode --

	Split mode is the name of the feature which allows the editing  and
viewing of two texts simultaneously. We use <F8> to turn it on or  off  and
<F9> to swap between texts.

	When the split mode becomes active, the screen is divided to  allow
the simultaneous view of both texts. At this moment, if we use <F9> we will
be able to go from one text to another without de-activate the split  mode,
that is, the screen will remain divided.

	Notice that, if in the last example, we had used <F8>  rather  than
<F9> the split mode would have  been  de-activated,  that  is,  the  screen
would have came back to "normal".

** Example **	When the MPW is ran with only a disk drive,  the  available
		memory is about 48K for the main text, and 48K more for the
		second text (split), that is, we have twice  the  available
		memory but it is equally shared between the two texts.

	Important!! Note that the clipboard is the same for the two  texts,
	so, it can be used to exchange data between the texts.


	-- The Preferences Window --

	The preferences window, is an internal set up which enables  us  to
change some of MPW characteristics while it is running, this window can  be
activated, at any time, with <F5>.

	Once in the preferences window, we can see a pull-down menu with 12
options. To select an option we should use  the  arrow  keys  to  move  the
select bar over the desired option, and then hit <Return>

	The existing options are described bellow:

- Text, paper, border and  title  color:  They  modify  the  color  of  the
  respective areas; the arrow keys increase / decrease the color value; the
  color value ranges from 0 to 511; to finish the modification use <Return>
  or <Esc>;

- Screen adjust: It is similar to BASIC's  set  adjust  command;  with  the
  arrow keys we can move the screen to the desired direction; the values of
  x and y range from -7  to  +8;  the  default  is  0,  0;  to  finish  the
  modification use <Return> or <Esc>;

- PAL mode: This feature is like AMIGA's PAL BOOTER, and it was  discovered
  by accident, it keys the video  signal  from  NTSC  (American)  to  PAL-G
  (European);

** Note **	In some TV sets, when the PAL mode is activated  the  image
		seems to "run"; to fix it  you  must  adjust  the  vertical
		synchronism;

- Interlace: It turns the interlace mode on or off; in some TV  sets,  with
  some color combinations, the interlace activated may make the  text  more
  visible;

- Key click: It turns the keyboard click sound on or off;

- Use and Cancel: After modify the previous options, we use  these  options
  to use or to cancel the modifications done.

- Save to disk: You must use this option when you want to  use  permanently
  the choosen options; a config file, MPW.INF, will be created on  disk  to
  keep the data about these options. So, while this file  exists,  the  MPW
  will be loaded with the same options;

- Default: This option reset all the others to their default.

** Extra Information **		You must not be used to the color range  of
				the MPW (0-511), it happens because the MPW
uses all the 512 colors of the MSX2 even in text mode. To  adjust  a  color
based in its RGB, use the following formula: R * 64 + G * 8 + B.


	-- Find & Replace Commands --

	One of the most elaborated features of the MPW  are  the  find  and
replace commands, in the MPW, we use Ctrl-Q-F to  just  find,  Ctrl-Q-A  to
find and replace, and Ctrl-L to continue a find & replace command.

	When we use Ctrl-Q-A or Ctrl-Q-F  the  find  &  replace  window  is
showed, in it we can see 3 fields to be filled. The first field asks us for
the object of our search, that is, what will be searched in the   text,  if
this field stays empty no action will be taken.

	The second field asks us for the string that will replace the first
(if it is found), that is, for what we want to change  what  we're  looking
for. If we just want to find something, this field must stay empty,  notice
that, it's here that we make the difference between find only  and  find  &
replace, it must stay well understood for the perfect understanding of  the
following information.

	The third field ask us for the search options, if this field  stays
empty the default options will be used. Bellow we  can  see  the  available
options, to activate these options we should type  the  highlighted  letter
of each option. Notice that we can even use all the  options  at  the  same
time, and that the options' respective letters can be typed in any order.

** Note **	Note that the tab character is showed as a  space,  but the
		MPW recognize it as tab. It was  done  due  to  the  screen
		available space.

	In the  MPW,  there  are  two  distinct  situations  that  must  be
considered: find only, that occurs when we leave  the  second  field  empty
- and find & replace, that occurs when we fill the first and second fields.
I'm telling it again for two reasons: first, because some options work in a
different manner in the two cases above - and because I know that this text
isn't well written (I'm afraid you don't  understand  what  I'm  trying  to
say).


	-- The Options for Find Only --

	If options field stays empty, the string of the first field will be
searched through text, as it was written (case sensitive search), from  the
cursor position on. If the desired text  can't  be  found,  the  respective
message will be showed; otherwise, the search will stop and the cursor will
stay over the first character of the string found.  By using Ctrl-L at this
moment will continue the search, that is, we can search next occurrence  of
the string. Notice that,  the  search  always  continues  from  the  cursor
position on.

	If we use the global option (G), we will  be  telling  the  MPW  to
search from the beginning of the text, down. But the Ctrl-L works  as  said
above.

	If there's a block defined and we use the  local  option  (L),  the
search will be done ONLY INSIDE THE BLOCK.  The  Ctrl-L  works  as  before,
inside and out of the block.

	Futhermore, we can use the  upper  option  (U),  that  indicates  a
non-case sensitive search, or be, the text will be found  independently  of
its form. (lowercase or uppercase).


	-- The Options For Find & Replace --

	If the options field stays empty, the string  of  the  first  field
will be searched through text, as it was written, from the cursor  position
on and, if it is not found, the respective message will be shown. Otherwise
the string found will be replaced by the second field string. Ctrl-L can be
used now to replace the next string in the text.

	If we use the global option (G), we will  be  telling  the  MPW  to
search from the beginning of the text as well as  to  replace  all  strings
found. If the N option  is  also  specified,  all  strings  found  will  be
replaced automaticaly, otherwise the MPW will ask if you  want  to  replace
each string found. So, we can choose which strings we want to  replace  and
which not.

	The find & replace process can be interrupted by pressing <Esc>  or
<Stop>, at the end of it the MPW shows the number of replaced strings.  The
Ctrl-L can be used to continue the search with the initial parameters.

	As said before, by using the local option (L), the search  will  be
done only inside of a defined block. The uppercase option (U) will work  as
expected.

** Note **	Remember that we can combine the  options  explained  above
		to, for example, replace all the  strings  inside  a  block
		automaticaly.


	-- Line Handling Commands --

Backspace		or Ctrl-H	Erase character on left
Delete			or Ctrl-G	Erase character under cursor

	-- Extra Commands --

	The following is a list of the  MPW  extra  commands.  I  like  the
Ctrl-Q-N, that's very useful when we want to go to a specific line.

Ctrl-Q-N				Go to line N;
Ctrl-K-D				Save text & quit;
Ctrl-K-S		or F2		Save text w.o./quit;
Ctrl-K-Q		or Ctrl-K-X	Quit program;
Tab			or Ctrl-I	Go to next tab;
Ctrl-Tab		or Ctrl-Q-I	Toggle indent mode;
Insert			or Ctrl-V	Toggle insert mode;
Shift-Insert				Copy clipboard to text.


	Well, I hope this klugde of documentation  is  enough  to  get  you
going - hmmm, better give you some gotcha's I've discovered...

			-- WATCH FOR --

-	The MPW can become slow when we're editing a big text,  it  happens
	due to its memory handling routines (it's gonna be improved  soon),
	if it happens, copy the part of text you're editing to  the  second
	text, and after edit it, copy it back into the main text;

-	When you're reading PC files, notice that some  characters  can  be
	inserted at the end of text, it may happen because some PC  editors
	don't put the Ctrl-Z (#1a) at the end of the text;

- 	MPW isn't perfect,  it  has  some  bugs  that  you'll  discover  by
	yourself, but it is nothing that prevents you from using it.

-	MPW is relatively complete, but  there's  always  another  day  and
	another MAC...	


	SO... Here's my "wish list"

	..it might save you telling me YOU  think  such-and-such  would  be
	nice...

-	MPW will be oriented by pull-down menus, like the  AMIGA  programs;
	the edit windows will be adjustable (size and position) like AMIGA!

-	MPW will have a right margin, page breaks and must justify the text

-	Find & replace window will be modified to get more friendly;

-	Import will be added to the program;

-	Tab size will be adjustable;

-	Printing routine will work it should does;

-	The clipboard and block handling will be improved to  allow  better
	edit capacibles.
